# Retro Racket Revolution
Paying homage to a little-known game from 1987 called [Batty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batty_(video_game)), published by Elite Systems, I give you Retro Racket Revolution! Batty was a Breakout / Arkanoid clone that I played on the ZX Spectrum. It had a few interesting features including a 2 player mode and Retro Racket Revolution takes the concept and adds a few tweaks and enhancements of its own.
